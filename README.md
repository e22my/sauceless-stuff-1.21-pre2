# The source-code for a Fabric Minecraft mod made for my personal use (WIP)

Inspired by the existing MineTreasure datapack/mod, the current plan is to develop a Fabric mod that causes 'lootboxes' to rarely drop from certain activities where the quality of loot will increase as a player completes certain advancements. The idea of the mod is to create a system that incentivizes players to engage with niche activities or self-imposed challenges within Minecraft.
